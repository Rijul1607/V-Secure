# **V-Secure**: An Intelligent Data-Driven Model to Secure Intra-Vehicle Communications üöóüõ°Ô∏è

## Overview

This project aims to secure intra-vehicle communications using a dual-layer model combining image-based and data-based approaches. By leveraging deep learning and structured data analysis, the system can effectively detect and prevent cyber threats, ensuring robust vehicle network security.

## Features

### Image-Based Model

- **Pattern Recognition in Visual Data:** Utilizes deep learning to analyze visual representations of network activity, such as CAN bus signal patterns or heatmaps, to detect unusual shapes or spikes that may indicate cyber threats.
- **Enhanced Detection of Anomalies:** Identifies deviations in normal waveform patterns to spot attacks that alter typical signal flow, such as spoofing or injection attacks.

### Data-Based Model

- **Structured Data Analysis:** Processes network data (e.g., frequency, timing, and sequence of sensor readings and messages) to detect irregularities that could signal attacks like Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) or Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Adaptable to Data Types:** Can analyze various structured data points from different Electronic Control Units (ECUs), allowing for a versatile approach across multiple vehicle components and communication protocols.

### Integrated Dual-Layer Security

- **Cross-Model Validation:** Combines outputs from both models to strengthen accuracy and minimize false positives, ensuring comprehensive detection across image and structured data.
- **Robust Against Complex Attacks:** Capable of detecting both visual and non-visual anomalies, covering a wide range of potential intra-vehicle threats.

## Common Cyber Threats

- **Fuzzy Attack:** A cybersecurity testing method where random, malformed, or unexpected data is fed to software, systems, or devices to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
- **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Overloads the vehicle network with false data to disrupt essential functions like braking or steering control.
- **Spoofing Attacks (RPM and Gear):** Injects false signals or messages into the network, impersonating legitimate components to mislead the vehicle system.

## Detection Challenges

- **Subtle, Low-Signal Attacks:** Sophisticated attackers often create small, unnoticeable anomalies, which are hard to distinguish from normal fluctuations in high-speed data flows.
- **High Data Volume:** Vehicle networks generate and exchange massive amounts of data in real-time, making it difficult to identify attacks without causing system delays.
- **Time-Sensitive Processing:** Attack detection must happen instantly to be effective, requiring highly optimized algorithms that balance security with processing speed.
